# assignment 2
1.	Given an input list removes the element at index 4 and add it to the 2nd position and also, at the end of the list
2.	Given a two list of equal size create a set such that it shows the element from both lists in the pair
Example: First List [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Second List [4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]
Result is {(6, 36), (8, 64), (4, 16), (5, 25), (3, 9), (7, 49), (2, 4)}
3.	Remove duplicate from a list and create a tuple and find the minimum and maximum number
4.	Write a function that converts a decimal number to binary number
5.	A number is called perfect if the sum of proper divisors of that number is equal to the number. For example 28 is perfect number, since 1+2+4+7+14=28. Write a program to print all the perfect numbers in a given range
6.	Two different numbers are called amicable numbers if the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number. For example 220 and 284 are amicable numbers.
Example: 
Sum of proper divisors of 220 = 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284
Sum of proper divisors of 284 = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220
Write a function to print pairs of amicable numbers in a range.
7.	Write a Python program that takes a number as input from the user and generate and print a dictionary of the form (x: x*x)
Sample input: (n = 5)
Output: (1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25)
8.	Write a Python program to combine two dictionary adding values for common keys.
Input:
D1 = {‘a’:100, ‘b’:200, ‘c’: 400}
D2 = {‘a’:300, ‘b’:100, ‘d’: 300}
Output: {‘a’:400, ‘b’:300, ‘c’:400, ‘d’:300}
